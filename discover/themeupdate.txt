1. Improve the Prompt with Examples and Better Framing
Instead of just telling the model to find "mid-level themes," show it what you mean:
pythonsystem_prompt = """You categorize tech discussions into recurring theme categories.

Your goal: Create labels that will naturally group 5-15 similar stories together.

Good themes (specific enough to be meaningful, general enough to recur):
- "AI Model Training Costs"
- "Developer Productivity Tools"
- "Privacy Regulation Impact"
- "Open Source Sustainability"
- "Cloud Service Outages"
- "Programming Language Design"
- "Startup Funding Challenges"

Bad themes (too specific - won't recur):
- "OpenAI GPT-4 Release"
- "Twitter Acquisition Details"
- "iOS 17 Bug Reports"

Bad themes (too general - not insightful):
- "Technology News"
- "Software Development"
- "Business Updates"

Output: A 2-5 word noun phrase describing the core recurring pattern.
Focus on: underlying issues, technical approaches, industry trends, or problem spaces.
Avoid: specific events, company names, product versions, or dates."""
2. Two-Pass Approach for Better Consistency
Consider having the model first identify key concepts, then map to a theme:
pythondef extract_theme_with_reasoning(text_content):
    """Extract theme with intermediate reasoning step."""
    
    # First pass: Extract key concepts
    concept_prompt = """List the 3 most important technical or business concepts in this discussion.
    Focus on: problems being solved, technologies used, industry challenges.
    One concept per line, 2-4 words each."""
    
    concepts = generate_completion(
        text_content[:4000],
        system_prompt=concept_prompt,
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=50
    )
    
    # Second pass: Generate theme based on concepts
    theme_prompt = f"""Given these key concepts from a tech discussion:
    {concepts}
    
    Create a single theme label that captures the core pattern.
    The theme should be specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to apply to similar discussions.
    Output: 2-5 word noun phrase only."""
    
    theme = generate_completion(
        "",
        system_prompt=theme_prompt,
        temperature=0.2,
        max_tokens=12
    )
    
    return theme.strip()
3. Add Context About Existing Themes
To improve consistency, you could maintain a cache of recently used themes and bias toward reusing them:
pythondef extract_theme_with_context(text_content, recent_themes):
    """Extract theme with awareness of existing theme categories."""
    
    theme_list = "\n".join(f"- {t}" for t in recent_themes[:20])
    
    system_prompt = f"""You categorize tech discussions into themes.

Recent themes in use:
{theme_list}

If this discussion fits well into an existing theme above, use that exact phrase.
If not, create a new theme following these rules:
- 2-5 word noun phrase
- Specific enough to group 5-15 similar stories
- General enough to recur over weeks/months
- No company names, versions, or specific events

Output the theme only, nothing else."""
    
    # Rest of the function...
4. Adjust Temperature and Sampling Parameters
Your current temperature (0.25) might be too low, causing the model to be overly conservative:
python# Try these adjusted parameters:
temperature=0.4,  # Slightly higher for more variety
top_p=0.85,       # Tighter nucleus sampling
top_k=30,         # Fewer token choices
repeat_penalty=1.2,  # Stronger penalty for repetition
max_tokens=15,    # Slightly more room for complete phrases
5. Pre-process the Input Text Better
Instead of just truncating at 8000 characters, be smarter about what you include:
pythondef prepare_text_for_theme_extraction(title, article_content, comments):
    """Prepare text focusing on most theme-relevant content."""
    
    # Priority 1: Title (always include)
    text_parts = [f"Title: {title}"]
    
    # Priority 2: First few paragraphs of article (usually contain main point)
    if article_content:
        # Take first 2000 chars of article
        text_parts.append(f"Article excerpt: {article_content[:2000]}")
    
    # Priority 3: Top-voted comments (often contain key insights)
    if comments:
        # Take first 1000 chars of comments
        text_parts.append(f"Key discussions: {comments[:1000]}")
    
    combined = "\n\n".join(text_parts)
    return combined[:6000]  # Leave room for better context
6. Add Validation and Fallback Logic
Sometimes the model will still produce bad themes. Add a validation step:
pythondef validate_and_clean_theme(theme):
    """Validate and potentially reject themes."""
    
    # Check for overly generic words
    too_generic = {'technology', 'software', 'computer', 'internet', 'digital', 'data'}
    theme_words = set(theme.lower().split())
    
    if len(theme_words) == 1 and theme_words.issubset(too_generic):
        return None  # Reject and regenerate
    
    # Check for specific company/product names (you'd expand this list)
    specific_names = {'google', 'microsoft', 'apple', 'meta', 'openai', 'gpt'}
    if any(name in theme.lower() for name in specific_names):
        # Try to generalize (this is a simple example)
        theme = theme.replace('Google', 'Search Engine')
        theme = theme.replace('OpenAI', 'AI Company')
        # etc...
    
    return theme
7. Consider Using Few-Shot Examples in Each Request
For Mistral-7B, including examples directly in the prompt can significantly improve performance:
pythonprompt = f"""Examples of good theme labels:
Story about PostgreSQL vs MySQL performance -> "Database Performance Comparison"
Story about React hooks causing memory leaks -> "Frontend Framework Issues"
Story about VC funding drying up in 2024 -> "Startup Funding Challenges"

Now categorize this story:
{truncated_content}

Theme:"""
The key insight is that a 7B parameter model needs much more explicit guidance than larger models. By providing examples, maintaining context, and using a multi-step approach, you should see much more consistent "middle ground" themes that are both insightful and reusable across multiple stories.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DRas well as doing this, is there a better larger model I could use?EditYes, there are several better models you could use for this task. Given that theme extraction is a relatively focused task that doesn't need massive context windows, here are my recommendations:
Best Options for Theme Extraction
1. Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (Recommended)

Why it's better: Much more capable than Mistral 7B at following complex instructions, better at abstraction
GGUF version: llama-3.1-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf or Q5_K_M.gguf if you have the RAM
Advantages: Excellent instruction following, good at finding the "middle ground" you're looking for
Size: ~4.5-5.5GB quantized

2. Mistral Nemo 12B Instruct

Why it's better: Newer architecture, specifically good at classification/categorization tasks
GGUF version: Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M.gguf
Advantages: 128k context window (though you don't need it all), very good at following structured outputs
Size: ~7GB quantized

3. Qwen 2.5 7B/14B Instruct

Why it's better: Latest architecture (Sept 2024), excellent at reasoning about categories
GGUF versions: qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf or qwen2.5-14b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf
Advantages: Very good at understanding nuance, handles the "not too specific, not too general" requirement well
Size: 4GB (7B) or 8GB (14B) quantized

4. Phi-3 Medium (14B)

Why it's better: Specifically trained for reasoning tasks, very efficient
GGUF version: phi-3-medium-14b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
Advantages: Excellent performance per parameter, good at taxonomies
Size: ~8GB quantized

For Your Specific Use Case, I'd Recommend:
Llama 3.1 8B Instruct with Q4_K_M or Q5_K_M quantization because:

It's only slightly larger than your current model but significantly more capable
Excellent at instruction following - it will better understand your nuanced requirements
Good at abstraction - can find patterns without being told exactly what to look for
Fast inference - still small enough to run quickly for bulk processing
Active community - lots of fine-tuned variants if you want to experiment

Implementation Suggestions for Better Models
With a more capable model like Llama 3.1 8B, you can use more sophisticated prompting:
pythondef extract_theme_llama3(text_content):
    """Enhanced theme extraction for more capable models."""
    
    system_prompt = """You are a technical content categorization expert. Your task is to identify the primary theme of discussions in a way that balances specificity with generality.

Think of themes as "folders" where similar discussions would naturally group together. Each folder should:
- Contain 5-15 similar discussions when applied across a large dataset
- Be specific enough to be insightful (not "Technology News")  
- Be general enough to recur over time (not "GPT-4 Released")
- Focus on patterns, problems, approaches, or trends

Before answering, consider:
1. What is the core issue or pattern being discussed?
2. Will this same theme likely appear in other discussions?
3. Is this specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to recur?

Output only the theme as a 2-5 word noun phrase."""

    # These models can handle more complex reasoning with slightly higher temperature
    theme = generate_completion(
        text_content[:10000],  # Can handle more context
        system_prompt=system_prompt,
        temperature=0.35,      # Can use slightly higher temp
        top_p=0.9,
        max_tokens=20,
        stop=['\n']
    )
    
    return theme.strip()
